# Changelog

All notable changes to this assessment are documented here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/) —
MAJOR = breaking item or scoring/report changes, MINOR = items, questions, or
additive scoring/report behavior, PATCH = wording fixes without semantic change.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Optional 15-item lite assessment profile with a 30–60 minute planning target for discovery and focused re-checks.
- Markdown checkpoint template and agent guidance for pausing and resuming interviews with confirmed answers, notes, and evidence references preserved.
- `coverage/` directory documenting point-by-point coverage of external frameworks, starting with the Joel Test (9/12 full, 3/12 partial), plus a template for future mappings.
- Twelve-Factor Methodology coverage mapping (5/12 full, 6/12 partial, 1 deliberately not covered).
- OWASP SAMM (OpenSAMM) coverage mapping against SAMM v2's 15 practices (6/15 full, 9/15 partial).
- ISO 25010 coverage mapping against the eight product quality characteristics (5/8 full, 3/8 partial), with a note on the 2023 revision's Safety characteristic.
- Fictional full sample report with checked weighted scores and gap priorities, including N/A and unknown answers.

### Changed
- Clarified that importance weights express team priorities while state 4 remains the common score reference. Defined confirmed, unknown, deferred, unconfirmed, N/A, and skipped answers; incomplete category scores are provisional, include coverage counts, and exclude unconfirmed rows from calculations.
- Added report context for system boundary, environment, selected profile/items, and evidence date, plus rules for changed weights and scope. Existing calculations for complete assessments remain unchanged. Release impact: MINOR; 0.1.1 incomplete reports are not comparable to provisional scores because their missing-answer behavior was undefined.
- Clarified the boundaries between review interaction and ownership, unit-test quality and release regression confidence, and regression confidence and CI/CD enforcement. Item IDs and assessed practices are unchanged.
- Set expectations for report audience and participant review, and added guidance for summarizing sensitive interview evidence without unnecessary identifying details.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Project title renamed to "Software Project Maturity Assessment" (was "Software Engineering Maturity Assessment"); index and report titles aligned.
- README description rewritten around the set-your-own-bar → measure → gap-roadmap flow and the assessor-or-LLM-agent choice.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- Structured item blocks (why it matters, what good looks like, questions to ask, red flags) for all categories.
- Importance/state scoring model with gap priority and category scores.
- `AGENT.md` LLM interview prompt and `templates/report.md` report template.
- LICENSE file (CC BY 4.0), this changelog, versioning policy.
- Quick start instructions and single-file bundle `service-audit-full.md` (built by `scripts/build-bundle.sh`) for attaching the whole assessment to a web-based LLM chat.

### Changed
- Split `ASSESSMENT.md` into per-category files under `assessment/`; `ASSESSMENT.md` is now the index.
- Moved "Team Health & Culture" from Processes (2.14) to Culture (7.5).
- Scoped 1.8 Compliance & Legal to product obligations; cross-referenced 6.10 for operations.
- Rescoped 6.7 to the org-wide vulnerability scanning and triage program; day-to-day dependency patching hygiene cross-referenced to 4.14.

### Fixed
- Numbering and wording defects ("13" item, "Feedbacks", "Groundrules", "Unit-tests", README link spacing).
