# 1. Product & Vision

Part of the [Software Project Maturity Assessment](../ASSESSMENT.md) — spec version 0.2.0.

### 1.1 Product Overview

**Why it matters:** If the team can't articulate the product, its users, and the problem it solves in plain language, every downstream decision — architecture, prioritization, hiring — is guesswork dressed up as strategy.

**What good looks like:** Any engineer on the team can explain in a couple of minutes who the product serves, what pain it removes, and why that matters, without reaching for a slide deck.

**Questions to ask:**
- If you stopped a random engineer in the hallway, could they describe the product and its core users in two sentences?
- Who is explicitly *not* the target user, and why was that boundary drawn?
- What problem does this solve that the user couldn't solve another way before?
- When did the product overview last change, and did the team notice?

**Red flags:** the description only exists in a founder's head or a pitch deck; engineers describe the product in purely technical terms with no mention of the user; "it does everything for everyone."

### 1.2 Product Vision / Mission

**Why it matters:** Without a shared long-term direction, teams optimize locally — every sprint looks reasonable in isolation but the product drifts without accumulating toward anything.

**What good looks like:** A concise, durable statement of where the product is headed exists, is written down, and is referenced (not just recited) when weighing competing priorities.

**Questions to ask:**
- Where is the vision written down, and when was it last revisited?
- Can you give an example of a decision the vision helped settle in the last quarter?
- If two people on the team described the vision independently, would they agree?
- Has the vision changed recently — and if so, does everyone know?

**Red flags:** vision statement is generic boilerplate that could apply to any company; it hasn't been mentioned in a planning meeting in over a year; leadership and engineering describe the direction differently.

### 1.3 Project Goals

**Why it matters:** Goals translate vision into something a team can actually plan against and measure; without them, "we're moving fast" substitutes for "we're moving somewhere."

**What good looks like:** Short- and mid-term goals are explicit, tied to measurable outcomes, and revisited on a predictable cadence rather than only when something goes wrong.

**Questions to ask:**
- What are this quarter's goals, and how do they connect to a business or user outcome?
- How do you know when a goal has been achieved — what's the measurable signal?
- What was the last goal that was missed, and what happened as a result?
- How often do stated goals change mid-cycle, and why?

**Red flags:** goals are activity-based ("ship feature X") rather than outcome-based; goals exist only as a Jira epic nobody reopens; no one can name this quarter's top goal without checking a document.

### 1.4 Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

**Why it matters:** Functional requirements describe what the product does; non-functional ones (security, scalability, reliability) determine whether it survives contact with real usage. Skipping either invites rework or outages later.

**What good looks like:** Requirements are captured somewhere durable, distinguish must-have from nice-to-have, and explicitly address non-functional concerns rather than leaving them implicit.

**Questions to ask:**
- Where do non-functional requirements (performance, security, availability) get written down, if anywhere?
- For the last major feature, how were "must have" and "nice to have" distinguished?
- What happens when a requirement conflicts with a deadline — who decides what gets cut?
- Can you point to a recent incident caused by an unstated non-functional requirement?

**Red flags:** requirements live only in a ticket title; non-functional requirements are never discussed until an incident forces the conversation; "we'll figure out scale when we get there" as a standing policy.

### 1.5 Product Roadmap

**Why it matters:** A roadmap turns goals into a sequence the team and stakeholders can plan around; without one, priorities feel arbitrary and dependencies get discovered too late.

**What good looks like:** A roadmap exists, is visible to the team, names dependencies and rough timing, and is updated often enough to stay credible rather than becoming decorative.

**Questions to ask:**
- Where does the roadmap live, and who can see it?
- When was it last updated, and does it reflect what's actually being worked on right now?
- What's an example of a dependency the roadmap surfaced before it became a blocker?
- How far out does the roadmap realistically hold — weeks, quarters, longer?

**Red flags:** the roadmap is a static slide from a quarterly business review; engineers learn about upcoming priorities from stand-up rather than the roadmap; dates are treated as commitments despite being guesses.

### 1.6 User Research & Feedback Loops

**Why it matters:** Product decisions made without user input are bets; regular, structured feedback loops turn those bets into informed choices and catch misdirection early.

**What good looks like:** There's a consistent mechanism for gathering user input (interviews, support signals, usage data, beta programs) and evidence that it actually changes what gets built.

**Questions to ask:**
- What's the most recent product decision that changed because of user feedback?
- How do insights from support tickets or sales calls make it back to the product team?
- Who talks to users directly, and how often?
- If a feature flopped, how would the team find out — and how would they know why?

**Red flags:** "we know what users want" asserted without a mechanism behind it; feedback is collected but has no visible path into planning; user research happened once, long ago, and hasn't been repeated.

### 1.7 Product Metrics & Analytics

**Why it matters:** Metrics are how a team tells the difference between shipping and succeeding; without them, launches are declared wins by default rather than by evidence.

**What good looks like:** A small set of meaningful metrics (adoption, engagement, quality) is tracked, visible to the team, and actually consulted when deciding what to build next.

**Questions to ask:**
- What are the two or three metrics that most define product success here?
- Who looks at the dashboard, and how often?
- Can you describe a time a metric moved unexpectedly and what the team did about it?
- How do you distinguish a vanity metric from one that drives a decision?

**Red flags:** metrics are tracked but nobody can recall the current numbers; dashboards exist but are never opened outside of a quarterly review; success is measured only by "did we ship it," not by impact.

### 1.8 Compliance & Legal Requirements

**Why it matters:** Compliance obligations (GDPR, accessibility, industry-specific regulation) carry legal and financial risk if ignored, and retrofitting them after the fact is far more expensive than designing for them upfront.

**What good looks like:** Applicable obligations are identified explicitly, someone is accountable for tracking them, and they inform product decisions rather than being discovered during an audit or a customer's security questionnaire. How compliance is operated day-to-day is assessed in [6.10](06-security-compliance.md#610-compliance--data-retention-policies).

**Questions to ask:**
- Which specific regulations or standards apply to this product, and who determined that list?
- Who owns compliance accountability — is there a named person or is it "everyone's job, so no one's"?
- What was the last compliance gap discovered, and how was it found — audit, incident, or customer question?
- How do new features get checked against compliance obligations before they ship?

**Red flags:** compliance is treated as a one-time checkbox rather than an ongoing obligation; no one can name which regulations apply; obligations are only discovered when a customer or regulator asks.

### 1.9 Other

Anything important to this category that the items above did not cover. Record it here with an importance and state rating like any other item.

### 1.10 User Experience & Accessibility

**Why it matters:** A product can meet its functional goals and still exclude people or make important tasks difficult. Understanding usability and accessibility needs early reduces barriers for users and costly redesign later.

**What good looks like:** The team understands the needs of its target users, evaluates important workflows with representative users or equivalent evidence, and checks that people with disabilities can complete them using relevant assistive technologies. Findings inform product decisions and are revisited as the product changes.

**Questions to ask:**
- How does the team learn whether users can complete the product's most important tasks?
- Which users, including people with disabilities, have been represented in that evidence, and whose needs may be missing?
- How are keyboard access, screen-reader support, and other relevant accessibility needs evaluated for the product?
- What usability or accessibility issue most recently changed a product decision, and how was the fix checked?
- Which accessibility standards or legal requirements apply, and how is that obligation tracked? Product obligations are assessed in [1.8](01-product-vision.md#18-compliance--legal-requirements); this item focuses on the user experience and product behavior.

**Red flags:** product decisions rely only on internal assumptions; important workflows have not been checked with users or representative evidence; accessibility is treated as a final checklist rather than part of design and development; known barriers have no owner or plan.
